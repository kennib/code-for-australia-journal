## Today's activities 

Today we sat in on a consultation between two members of the 'Heritage near me' team.
It gave us a bit more insight into the motivations of the OEH, local councils and their heritage teams.

The major take away was that the 'Heritage near me' app seems like an afterthought in the wider 'Heritage near me' program.
The program consists of three parts.
First, grants which are designed to help heritage listings create tourism and business.
Then there is a 'Heritage Roadshow' team, which seems to be underspecified at the moment, but is a team for 'getting shit done' in regards to heritage projects.
Finally is the app, which seems to be conceived as a way to inform the public (and tourists) of the heritage around them and encourage them to engage with it more.
I have doubts about how much thought was put into the how the app can achieve this goal, given that informing people of a heritage location is not the same as encouraging them to go there.

The council staff seemed encouraged by the grants.
The OEH told us that the some councils had even more projects they thought were grant applicable, while others had no idea.

The council staff were very vocal about their frustrations with the heritage listing process.
They expressed that is was very confusing.
The people they talked to didn't know what it meant to be listed, didn't know about the interaction between state and local heritage and didn't know what they could do when performing renovations to their houses.
I think there is huge opportunity for improvement here.

When talking more specifically about the app it seemed like the council staff wanted control over content.
There was also talk of including event listings and the like.
Also mentioned was using the app as a place to crowd source stories about local heritage.

Jesse and I had a discussion about the idea of crowd sourcing within the app.
Jesse mentioned that we want to avoid the app turning into Trip Advisor.
That is, we should lean towards crowd sourced content that provides things like historical context as opposed to reviews of tourist attractions.
I think that crowd sourced content is only as good as your crowd and we need to focus on local historical and heritage societies.
Curation is also a key factor in making the content work.

We also went to the 'Heriatge near me' Christmas party.
This helped us to get to know the team and their personalities a bit better.
One worrying thing that came up was that is seems like the staff are under the impression we are just there to build the app.
I think they believe our particular expertise in understanding the public and being civic minded will be used to improve the social, interactive part of the app.
Not change the conception of the app itself.
