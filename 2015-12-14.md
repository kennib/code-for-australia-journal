## Today's activities 

Today we had introductions, orientation around the Sydney HUB and an exploration of the "Heritage near Me" project.

It's not apparent to me yet where we're going with the project for this week.
I think I really need to understand what our goals are here.
It seems like there are weird conflicting aims between Code for Australia, OEH and the idea of civic coding.
That's not even getting into organisations that work around the OEH like the National Trust.

I'm still unclear about what I need in order to improve my experience of being inducted into Code for Australia.
I am hoping that it will become a bit more clear in the next few days.

Mostly I'm just a bit confused.
