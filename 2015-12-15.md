## Today's activities

Today I explored the Office for Environment and Heritage's (OEH) website in a bit more depth.
Jesse and I found some pages which talk about heritage in general and the 'Heritage Near Me' app specifically.
I also took a look at the current database schema and some of the contents.
It's in a Microsoft Access database format, so there's an obvious point of improvement from an open data perspective.

We talked to Claire from the OEH over the phone.
She confirmed our suspicion that the Minister wanting an app was a huge part of the impetus for this project.
It seems like they are consulting with different organisations and the moment.
Jesse and I will be able to tag along on one of these consultations.

It also seems like there is a vague plan to have user generated content for the app.
This seems like the sort of thing Jesse and I need to explore more deeply.
Our initial impressions from independent research is that this is difficult to pull off
and that the most successful instances of crowd sourcing data in this way are seeded with high quality content.
It would be nice to talk to Simon Mathews the UX person on the Culture Walk app.

I also took a look at Beacon Maker.
They use iBeacons to feed people information at different landmarks using apps.
They have a few apps for places in Sydney.
I'd like to take a look at them tomorrow.

I took a look at existing travel/culture/exploration apps.
Particularly, the "Sydney Culture Walks" app.
My initial impressions are that this is the most liked app of its kind in Sydney/NSW.
Part of the reason is a good UX from an application side, the other part is a sharp focus from the content side.
My understanding is that the content was derived from brochures the City of Sydney already had.

My biggest issue at the moment is that the training material from Code for Australia has not been particularly helpful.
I think this is because the content has been mashed into 8 days and appears as needless fluff without a practical context to apply it within.
I've found it hard to communicate this issue to Jacob and Alvaro.
Each time I mention the difficulties of following the training guidelines as proposed I feel as if the answer I get back are very defensive.

Something I'd like to do before the week is up is to actually talk to tourists and people visiting heritage sites.
Jesse and I have talked about it, but haven't taken the final step of actually getting out there and doing it.
If there's one thing I think I'll need to learn before embarking on the real project it is how not to be a chicken about talking to users/public.
