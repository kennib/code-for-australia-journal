## Today's activities

Today I went on a "Sydney Culture Walk" to get a feel for how the app works.

My observations were that the app tried to keep things simple. There wasn't information overload.
The app tried to balance the map and the information.
There was a lot of switching between the map and the info and this interaction was made very simple by having the information slide over top of the map without completely hiding it.
You could easily slide back and forth between attractions.

I noticed a lot of the interactions that made the app pleasant to use relied on swiping gestures.
This means that this app wouldn't really work as a responsive websites, because ironically the interactions in a non-native app are not very responsive.

I noticed that the timing of the information to read was important and depends on the pace of the walker.
The creator of the content needs to be able choose appropriate places for the walkers to stop so they aren't in the flow of pedestrian traffic and can appreciate the sights around them.
It seems that that the difference between good and bad content is subtle but huge.
This makes me think that crowd sourcing content would not be a very good proposition.
Perhaps getting enthusiasts to provide content would be a better option.

While looking at old pictures on the culture walk app I came up with an idea for a different app concept.
Imagine combining photos of a building over time to get a picture of the transformation of both the building and surroundings.
This reminded me of a piece of research I saw on automatically generating time lapses from internet photos.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any openly available code for the time lapse mining specifically.
It would be interesting to contact the people involved if my app idea turns out to be a good path based on user talks.

I also found a service by Microsoft that stitches together photos to make smooth 3D tours.
This could be another interesting idea to explore.
